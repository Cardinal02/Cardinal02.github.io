    <h2>War Bird Game Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Overall Vision</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        War Bird is a space-themed shoot-em-up game. The player controls the
        Quadjet whose goal is to shoot laser and destroy asteroids that are
        flying around the screen. The ultimate goal is to shoot all the
        asteroids flying around.
      </li>
      <li>This is a single-player action game.</li>
      <li>
        This game is appropriate for all ages and is simple enough to be enjoyed
        by casual gamers. The target platform is desktop computers, and the game
        is controlled with the keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        This game is fast-paced, and average gameplay sessions will be only a
        few minutes long.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Abilities</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Quadjet moves by rotating left and right and accelerating forward in
        the direction it is facing. There is no deceleration; to stop or reverse
        direction, the Quadjet must rotate and accelerate in the opposite
        direction.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Quadjet is able to shoot lasers (one per second), which travel in a
        straight line for one second, then fade out and disappear from the game
        if they haven’t collided with a asteroid. If a laser hits a asteroid,
        the asteroid and the laser are both destroyed.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Quadjet is surrounded by a whipple shield that provides impact
        resistance. If the Quadjet is hit by an asteroid while the shields are
        active, the asteroid is destroyed and the shields lose power. After
        shield power is reduced to 0, the shields disappear, and being hit by an
        asteroid destroys the Quadjet and ends the game.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Quadjet also has the ability to instantly and randomly teleport to a
        new location on the screen. While this can be used for quick escapes
        from an imminent collision, there is the possibility of teleporting onto
        an asteroid, and so the player may choose to use this ability sparingly
        (only in case of imminent destruction) or perhaps not at all.
      </li>

      <li>
        The only active obstacles are the asteroids that the Quadjet must avoid
        and shoot; they have random initial directions and speeds within a given
        range.
      </li>

      <li>
        The number of laser the player can fire are unlimited; the only resource
        the player needs to be aware of is the remaining shield power.
      </li>

      <li>
        The game world is a single screen, but features wraparound: after an
        object (Quadjet, asteroid, or laser) moves past one edge of the screen,
        it reappears on the opposite edge. This design makes the game world feel
        larger (by not having a boundary) while still allowing the player to see
        all objects in the game world at the same time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dynamics</h3>

    <li>
      To play this game, a desktop computer is required. Navigating the menus
      requires a mouse to click on various buttons. The Quadjet is controlled
      entirely by the keyboard: left/right arrow keys rotate the ship, up arrow
      activates the thrusters and accelerates the ship forward, spacebar shoots
      lasers, and the X key teleports the Quadjet to a random location.
    </li>

    <li>
      To be proficient at this game, the player will need to be able to
      precisely control the movement of the Quadjet and predict the position of
      the asteroids to line up shots from a distance. Maintaining a large
      distance between the Quadjet and the asteroids minimizes the chance that
      the shields will be damaged.
    </li>

    <li>
      The amount of power remaining in the shields is indicated visually by the
      shield graphic.
    </li>

    <li>
      When all asteroids have been emiminated, a congratulations message appears
      on the screen.
    </li>

    <li>
      There will be a start menu that displays a title graphic and the
      backstory. The instructions lists the controls for the game.
    </li>

    <li>
      When the player loses the game, a “Better Luck Next Time” message appears.
    </li>

    <li>
      when all the asteroids have been eliminated the game is won and a
      "Congratulations!" messag appears.
    </li>

    <li>
      There is no in-game pause or volume-control functionality. The player can
      quit the game at any time by clicking on the standard window controls
      located in the top-right corner of the window.
    </li>

    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>

    <li>The game is set in outer space.</li>
    <li>The graphics are colorful and animated.</li>
